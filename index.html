                <h3>What types of rules or agreements exist to ensure a fair distribution of water from the Black Sea between countries? 
</h3>
                <p>The focus of the rules and agreements in Georgia are on maritime use, environmental protection and shipping rights. There are several regulations, such as Bucharest Convention(1992), United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea and Black Sea Economic Cooperation. 
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>  Bucharest Convention(1992)-The Black Sea Commission is the regional governing body created to implement the Bucharest Convention signed by the six coastal countries in 1992. The areas of work of the Black Sea Commission are, inter alia, to monitor and assess pollution, control pollution from land-based sources, ensure conservation of biological diversity, address environmental safety aspects of shipping, address environmental aspects of management of fisheries and other marine living resources(UN Environment programme, n.d.).
</li>
                    <li>United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea -The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was adopted in 1982. It lays down a comprehensive regime of law and order in the world's oceans and seas establishing rules governing all uses of the oceans and their resources. It embodies in one instrument traditional rules for the uses of the oceans and at the same time introduces new legal concepts(IMO, n.d.)  
</li>
                    <li>Black Sea Economic Cooperation is a unique and promising model of multilateral political and economic initiative with the signing of the Istanbul Summit Declaration and the Bosphorus Statement by the Heads of State and Government of the countries in the region, on 25 June 1992. BSEC covers a geography encompassing the territories of the Black Sea littoral States, the Balkans and the Caucasus with an area of nearly 20 million square kilometers. The BSEC region is located on two continents(BSEC, n.d.)

                <ul>
                    <li>Georgia managing shared marine resources fairly and sustainably with powerful neighbors like Turkey and Russia. It is depended on joint environmental agreements, regulations to protect marine environment. Georgia benefits from cleaner water resources and biodiversity conservations, which are essential for the eco-tourism and coastal livelihoods. Agreements with Turkey and Russia help ensure free and safe access to sea lanes for exports and imports. Peaceful cooperation boosts Georgia’s trade, port development, and foreign investment. Therefore, Georgia supports sustainable development through cleaner waters, safer trade, and resource protection

                    <li>From Georgia’s perspective, current agreements — like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Bucharest Convention  treat all Black Sea countries as equals on paper. These agreements grant fair rights to marine resources, environmental protection, and shipping lanes. However, Georgia faces serious disadvantages in practice due to differences in economic development, infrastructure, and regional influence.

                <h3>What types of rules or agreements exist to ensure a fair distribution of water from the Black Sea between countries? 
</h3>
                <p>Turkey is involved in both bilateral and regional agreements that regulate water sharing in the Black Sea region. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most important is the 1927 Treaty on the Beneficial Uses of Boundary Waters, also known as the Kars Protocol. It was signed with the USSR and renewed with Georgia in 1990. This treaty applies to the Çoruh River, which flows from Turkey into Georgia. It requires equal (50-50) sharing of water, joint monitoring stations, and cooperation in planning any dams or other infrastructure that could affect water flow (Follow the River, 2021). The treaty also includes a compensation mechanism in case of harm, even if precautions are taken.
</li>
                    <li>Turkey also participates in regional frameworks such as the Black Sea Strategic Action Plan (BS SAP). This plan was developed with all six Black Sea countries and promotes responsible environmental management. It follows principles like Integrated River Basin Management, which encourages countries to manage water as part of a larger ecosystem rather than focusing on national borders (JRC, 2016). While this plan does not assign water quantities, it supports monitoring, pollution control, and cooperation on freshwater issues across the region.

                <h3>How does the system of water sharing between Turkey, Russia, and Georgia in the Black Sea impact sustainable development in the region?
</h3>
                <p>Water sharing between Turkey, Russia, and Georgia affects sustainable development in many ways.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> For example, Turkey has built hydropower plants on the Çoruh River without consistently working with Georgia. These projects have caused environmental concerns, such as damage to ecosystems and erosion near the river's mouth. Courts and local experts have warned that building dams without protecting the natural balance of the river could lead to irreversible harm (Follow the River, 2021).
</li>
                    <li>Although there are agreements in place, their implementation is uneven. The Black Sea Strategic Action Plan tries to promote sustainable development through shared environmental efforts. It includes goals like pollution monitoring and protecting biodiversity (JRC, 2016). However, the region still faces challenges like weak laws, poor coordination, and lack of technical capacity, especially in less developed countries (CGScholar, 2023). </li>
                    <li>Other large projects, such as the Turkish Stream pipeline, show how development goals sometimes take priority over environmental planning. These overlapping interests highlight the need for stronger cooperation and more balanced decision-making (TASS, 2017).
n</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Are current water-sharing agreements in the Black Sea fair, considering the different levels of development in these countries?
</h3>
                <p>Agreements like the Kars Protocol appear fair on paper.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They promise equal sharing and joint responsibility (Follow the River, 2021). However, in reality, fairness depends on how agreements are implemented. Turkey has more technical and financial power than Georgia. It has advanced large dam projects on the Çoruh River without always consulting its neighbor. This puts Georgia at a disadvantage and shows how formal equality may not lead to fair results.
</li>
                    <li>Weaker countries often lack the tools to monitor environmental damage or defend their interests. The lack of strong regional laws and limited cooperation systems makes it harder for less developed countries to enforce agreements (CGScholar, 2023). Better monitoring and data access also give stronger countries more power in negotiations. Long-term infrastructure deals, such as the Turkish Stream pipeline, may also shape regional development in ways that benefit wealthier states for decades (TASS, 2017). To achieve real fairness, countries need better enforcement, stronger support for weaker partners, and more open planning across borders.

                <p>According to G. Blackburn(2025), Ukraine and Russia have agreed to a ceasefire in the Black Sea, the US has announced.
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In two separate statements released on Tuesday, the White House said that Kyiv and Moscow "have agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea".The development comes after three days of talks between the US and the two adversaries in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh.The meetings did not involve any direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials.In its almost identical readouts — one about Russia, the other about Ukraine — the White House confirmed that both countries also agreed to "develop measures" to "ban strikes against energy facilities".The Trump administration went on to reiterate that "the killing on both sides ... must stop".
</li>
                    <li>Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov warned that any Russian military vessel movement outside the eastern Black Sea would threaten Ukraine’s national security and justify self-defence. He emphasized Ukraine’s stance on X, saying such actions violate safe navigation agreements.

                <p>According to Dr. M. Tseretelli(2021), Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Unites States, together with Turkey and other Western allies, led the process of strengthening the political and economic sovereignty of the former Soviet Bloc countries like Romania and Bulgaria, as well as newly independent countries in the South Caucasus and Central Asia. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Black Sea is a significant international waterway for energy flows. Multiple seaports specialize in oil and oil product exports, and two major natural gas pipelines cross the Black Sea, linking Russia and Turkey. In addition, significant oil and natural gas flows via land pipelines in the Black Sea region from the Caspian, via Georgia, to Turkey and onward to European markets. Russia exports more than 2 million barrels a day from Black Sea outlets, mainly from Novorossiysk. </li>

                <p>According to Melvin and Seskuria (2022), Russia’s war against Ukraine has destabilized the Black Sea region, increasing insecurity among surrounding states.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Russia’s militarization and regional ambitions have pushed the transatlantic community to reassess its approach. Georgia, as an a non-NATO littoral state with Russian-occupied territories, remains especially vulnerable to current pressure from Moscow.
on</li>
                    <li>Russia’s Black Sea policies have profoundly altered Georgia’s security, both internally and externally. The 2008 Russia–Georgia War marked a key shift by Moscow in its policy towards the Black Sea as it sought to counter Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic ambitions.
</li>
                    <li>Domination of the maritime Black Sea has been a goal for Russia’s regional strategy to threaten NATO and non-NATO partners from the sea, but it has also allowed Moscow to divide the region and to isolate countries. The Black Sea Fleet and access to Sevastopol have been at the core of this policy.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                <p>Water-sharing and maritime agreements in the Black Sea—like the Bucharest Convention, UNCLOS, and BSEC—aim to support fair use, environmental protection, and safe trade. On paper, they treat all countries equally. However, in practice, power differences affect how fair and effective these agreements are.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Georgia</b>, with limited resources, depends on cooperation to protect its environment and access trade routes. While agreements help, Georgia often lacks the power to fully enforce its rights, especially when stronger neighbors like Turkey make decisions—such as building dams—without full coordination.</li>
                    <li><b>Turkey</b> plays a leading role, using its stronger economy and infrastructure to push development, sometimes at the cost of shared environmental planning.</li>
               <li><b>Russia </b>uses its military and energy influence to control key routes and shape regional politics, which can limit cooperation and fairness.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, while agreements in the Black Sea region help support peace, trade, and environmental protection, they are not always fair in practice. Stronger countries have more power and resources, which gives them an advantage. To make the system truly fair, rules need to be enforced more equally. Weaker countries like Georgia should get more support so they can fully take part and protect their interests. Better cooperation is also needed, with all countries working together, sharing decisions, and respecting each other’s needs. This is the only way to reach real fairness and long-term sustainability in the region.</p>
